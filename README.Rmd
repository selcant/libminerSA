# libminerSA

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of libminer is to provide an overview of your R library setup. It is a toy package created as a part of a workshop and not meant for serious use.

## Installation

You can install the development version of libminerSA from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("selcant/libminerSA")
```

## Example

To get a count of installed packages in each of your library locations, optionally with the total sizes, use the `lib_summary()` function:


```{r example}
library(libminerSA)
lib_summary()
# specify `sizes = TRUE` to calculate the total size on disk of your packages
lib_summary(sizes = TRUE)
```
